# csr-pytorch
 Continuous speech recognition using pytorch

---

##Pipeline:

* Reads wav form from hdf5  
* Transforms it into a spectrogram
* Input spectrogram to CNN to give probability distribution of phoneme classes including blank
* The probability distribution is input to CTC for decoding and computing loss compared to true label sequence

---

##**Datasets:**
* Google speech commands (currently used) "../data/"
* Generated dataset  (not yet implemented)

These require different dataloaders since the conversion from word to phoneme sequence is hard coded currently

##TODO:
**Take care of random scripts.**


**CTC Decoding:**  
[ ] Greedy  
[ ] Beam search  
[ ] CTC_Loss ?  
[ ] LER/Edit distance??
