#Pipeline:

* Reads wav form from hdf5  
* Transforms it into a spectrogram
* Input spectrogram to CNN to give probability distribution of phoneme classes including blank
* The probability distribution is input to CTC for decoding and computing loss compared to true label sequence

---

#**Datasets:**
* Google speech commands (currently used) "../data/"
* Generated dataset  (not yet implemented)

These require different dataloaders since the conversion from word to phoneme sequence is hard coded currently

**RNN:**
* N x 1 x F x T
* -> Conv
* N x FM x F x T

* Combine before RNN ->
* N x (FM*F) x T

* Reorder ->
* N x T x (FM*F)
* T x N x (FM*F)

* Rnn defined such that: FM*F = input_size, hidden_size = some value
* Then add a fully connected layer after that projects hidden_size for each timestep to number of classes.
